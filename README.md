ML models

This repository contains the code for predicting breast cancer diagnosis using two machine learning models:1)Linear Regression and 2)Random Forest Classifier. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The Linear Regression model uses a linear approach to identify the relationship between independent variables and tumor diagnosis, while the Random Forest Classifier utilizes uses learning to construct decision trees for accurate classification.
