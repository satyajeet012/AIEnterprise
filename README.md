Welcome to the Fish Species Prediction Model repository! This project contains a machine learning model trained to predict the species of a fish based on its physical attributes such as weight, length, height, and width. The model, implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library, is trained on a dataset available in the fish.csv file. It utilizes a Random Forest classifier, chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and prevent overfitting. The model is deployed as a Flask web application on Heroku, allowing users to interact with it via a user-friendly interface. To use the model, simply visit the deployed application URL, enter the fish's attributes into the input form, and click "Predict" and it will give prediction of which fish it is.
